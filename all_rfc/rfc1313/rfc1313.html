Welcome!

   Hi and welcome to KRFC Internet Talk Radio, your place on the AM dial
   for lively talk and just-breaking news on internetworking.  Sponsored
   by the Internet Society, KRFC serves the San Francisco Bay Area.  For
   those of you outside the Bay Area, copies of program transcripts can
   be anonymously FTPed from archives.krfc.com the day after the
   program, or you can listen in via vat.

   Here's today's programming for today, Wednesday, 1 April 1992.

Hacker's Hour with Phil Karn (Midnight)

   Phil's special guest today is Dr. David Mills, who will explain the

   flying on the Concorde.

Nighttime News (1AM)

   Award winning Nighttime News gives you a full hour on those key facts
   you need to know before going to bed.  Be sure to catch our network

Late At Night With Ole (2 AM)

   Call in your favorite Internetwork questions to Ole Jacobsen and his
   guests.  Tonite's featured guests are John Moy, prime author of OSPF,
   and Milo Medin who will talk about how OSPF is great, but you really
   need to test it on 1822 networks to understand why.

The Protocol Police (8 PM)

   Liven up your evening with the protocol police.  Join our intrepid
   team of Stev Knowles and Mike St. Johns as they debug various TCP/IP
   implementations from the comfort of Mike's hot tub using Stev's
   water-proof portable PC.  Last week they caught Peter Honeyman
   hijacking an NFS implementation.  This week they're joined by Yakov
   Rehkter with his new Roto-Router tool, designed to catch routing
   anomalies.  Who will our team nab this week?

Family Hour (10 PM)

   As part of this week's special series on children and networking, Bob
   Morris and Jerry Estrin talk about how much you should teach your
   young children about networking.

Securely Speaking (11 PM)

   latest security news (if they're allowed to talk about it).  And
   remember, just after 11 o'clock Steve and Steve will be reading this
   week's encrypted message.  If you're the first caller to call in with
   the right DES key to decrypt the message, you'll win $1,000 and an
   all expenses paid trip to Ft. Meade!  (US nationals only please).

Security Considerations

   Security issues are discussed in the above section.
