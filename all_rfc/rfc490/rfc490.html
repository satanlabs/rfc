                       SURROGATE RJS FOR UCLA-CCN


    By using UCSB's Network Standard RJS* users can now gain access to
UCLA-CCN's RJS without converting to the UCLA protocol.  In addition,
the need to use and create files in an intermediate host is avoided.
For example, TIP users may operate with hot card readers and printers
through UCSB's Remote Job Server and have their jobs execute at UCLA-
CCN.  The disadvantages of this scheme as compared to direct connections
to UCLA are as follows:

    1.  A small amount of additional JCL is required to route jobs from
        UCSB to UCLA.

    2.  A UCSB batch account must be opened.

    3.  Turnaround time includes waits in UCSB batch queues.

    4.  The current implementation requires separate submission and
        retrieval steps.

    5.  The RJS terminal used for submission/retrieval at UCLA-CCN
        should not be accessed online until all transfers to/from UCSB
        are complete.

Hopefully, these disadvantages are outweighed by the convenient
interface to standard RJS.

    Attached is the document which describes this procedure to access
UCLA-CCN.

                  UCLA REMOTE JOB SUBMISSION FROM UCSB


Introduction
------------

    Users of the IBM 360/75 at UCSB may now route jobs to and from
UCLA-CCN (IBM 360/91).  Only the reading, printing, and punching are
handled at UCSB while the scheduling, allocation of resources, and
execution are handled at UCLA. The program described below operates by
establishing operator and data connections with UCLA's Remote Job
Service through the ARPA Network and issuing operator commands to
control the submission and retrieval of jobs.  Thus it is possible for a
user to run jobs on UCLA's 360/91 almost as if he were at UCLA.

Procedure
---------

    Submission and retrieval are two separate phases which the user must
initiate for each of his UCLA destined jobs.  Usually, two UCSB jobs
will be required for the two phases of one UCLA job.  Exceptions do
occur using the BATCH options described below and jobs with a guaranteed
fast UCLA turnaround (e.g. QUICKRUN jobs.)

    Commands are issued through JCL to the local process and resultant
actions and messages are recorded in the RJS system log on the user's
listing.  The user must be aware of the timing of his commands, e.g. a
request to retrieve print output for a specific job will result in an
error condition if the job has not finished executing at UCLA.
Available commands are READ, PRINT, PUNCH, STATUS, and TERMID.

    Effort has been made to provide the user with fairly intelligible
error diagnostics although this is not always possible.  Error
conditions are described in the section "ERRORS".

Job Submission
--------------

    The READ command is used to send jobs to UCLA.  It is the default
command if none other is specified.  UCLA jobs may be batched together
under a single read operation.  Great care should be taken to terminate
the batch with the correct delimiter (see DD Cards below) so that any
following non-UCLA jobs won't be sent to UCLA by mistake.  A suggested
procedure, if submitting jobs from the campus computer center, would be
to indicate on the job submission card the intended destination.  If the
job is accepted by UCLA a message from UCLA will be recorded indicating
the job name and number of cards received.

Single Job Retrieval
--------------------

    PRINT (JOBNAME) and PUNCH (JOBNAME) are used to explicitly fetch
print and punch output, respectively.  The UCLA RESET command is used to
set all job priorities the same, and then to set the named job's
priority to the highest value.  An unknown command, HEREIAM, is used for
synchronization purposes only.  If the named job is not ready for output
the local process will terminate with a timeout error (the current timer
is set at one minute).

Multiple Job Retrieval
----------------------

    PRINT (*) and PUNCH (*) are used to fetch all waiting output.  These
commands should always be preceded by the TERMID command.  Users who
have their own RJS terminal assigned to them will use this mode.

UCSB Job Control Cards
----------------------

    EXEC Card

    The catalogued procedure to executed is named UCLARJS.  Parameters
are used to specify which functions are to be performed.  The general
form of the execute card is:

        //anyname EXEC UCLARJS, PARM.RJS-'...functions...'


PARM Field
----------

    The following list defines the allowable parameters and their
indicated functions.  All parameters are executed in sequence and
separated by commas.

    READ - Open the reader channel and send 80 column records from the
           SYSIN data set.

    PRINT(JOBNAME) - Set indicated job's priority to highest value and
           retrieve the print output to the SYSPRINT data set. Records
           over 132 characters are folded to the next line.

    PRINT (*) - Retrieve all print jobs.

    PUNCH(JOBNAME) - Set indicated job's priority to highest value and
           retrieve 80 column punch output to the SYSPUNCH data set.



<span class="grey">Pickens                                                         [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc490">RFC 490</a>                SURROGATE RJS FOR UCLA-CCN             March 1973</span>


    PUNCH (*) - Retrieve all punch jobs.

    STATUS - Query UCLA about the status of all jobs assigned to this
           RJS terminal.

    TERMID(NAME-PASSWORD) - Sign on as named RJS terminal.  PASSWORD is
           optional and should be declared only if the terminal has a
           password.  The local process always signs on initially as
           NETUCSB.

DD Cards
--------

    1.  Reader - The SYSIN data set should have the following format to
          be able to send JCL and /* cards:

       // RJS.SYSIN DD DATA,DLM=$$,DCB=(RECFM=F,LRECL=80,BLKSIZE=80)
                       .
                       .
                       .
                    job(s)
                       .
                       .
                       .
       $$ (note, this special delimiter is required)

    2.  Printer - The default RJS.SYSPRINT data set is specified as
          SYSOUT=A

    3.  Punch - The default RJS.SYSPUNCH data set is specified as
          SYSOUT=B

    4.  RJS log - The default RJS.MESSAGES data set is specified as
          SYSYOUT=A

Problems and Errors
-------------------

    Most problems encountered fall into one of the following categories:

    1.  UCLA-CCN or ARPANET down.
          This condition is usually noted when the local process
          attempts connection with UCLA.  The error message is usually
          "INITIAL CONNECTION OPEN ERROR."

    2.  RJS terminal in use by a non-UCSB-jobshop process.
          This can occur if a user submits a job but signs on to his
          UCLA RJS terminal online prior to the local batch process



<span class="grey">Pickens                                                         [Page 4]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-5" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc490">RFC 490</a>                SURROGATE RJS FOR UCLA-CCN             March 1973</span>


          coming into execution.  This condition is usually noted by the
          appearance of "FAILURE OR TIMEOUT IN OPERATOR, PRINT OR PUNCH
          CHANNEL" with completion code 252.

    3.  Job not ready to be retrieved.
          The local process attempts to set the priority of the
          indicated job but receives no successful response.  This
          condition is also noted by the appearance of "FAILURE OR
          TIMEOUT IN OPERATOR, PRINT OR PUNCH CHANNEL" with completion
          code 252.

    4.  UCLA is unable to retrieve output because of an age-old bug.
          Unfortunately this condition can occur for very small amounts
          of output.  It is usually noted by the message "BEGINNING
          RETRIEVAL OF" followed by "(PROBABLE UCLA BUG)..  PREVIOUSLY
          GOOD CONNECTION NOW HAS STATUS = 8".  The output in this case
          is usually lost.

Cases 1 through 3 are corrected by waiting and then trying again.  Other
error messages may require reference to the NETWORK USER GUIDE or
consultation with Computer Center or Computer Systems Lab personnel.
