<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-1" href="#section-1">1</a>.  Introduction</span>

   The Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) protocol [<a href="#ref-BFD" title="&quot;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection&quot;">BFD</a>] defines a
   method for liveness detection of arbitrary paths between systems.
   The BFD one-hop specification [<a href="#ref-BFD-1HOP" title="&quot;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for IPv4 and IPv6 (Single Hop)&quot;">BFD-1HOP</a>] describes how to use BFD
   across single hops of IPv4 and IPv6.

   BFD can also be useful on arbitrary paths between systems, which may
   span multiple network hops and follow unpredictable paths.
   Furthermore, a pair of systems may have multiple paths between them
   that may overlap.  This document describes methods for using BFD in
   such scenarios.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-1.1" href="#section-1.1">1.1</a>.  Conventions Used in This Document</span>

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in <a href="./rfc2119">RFC 2119</a> [<a href="#ref-KEYWORDS" title="&quot;Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels&quot;">KEYWORDS</a>].

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-2" href="#section-2">2</a>.  Applicability</span>

   Please note that BFD is intended as an Operations, Administration,
   and Maintenance (OAM) mechanism for connectivity check and connection
   verification.  It is applicable for network-based services (e.g.
   router-to-router, subscriber-to-gateway, LSP/circuit endpoints, and
   service appliance failure detection).  In these scenarios it is
   required that the operator correctly provision the rates at which BFD
   is transmitted to avoid congestion (e.g link, I/O, CPU) and false
   failure detection.  It is not applicable for application-to-
   application failure detection across the Internet because it does not
   have sufficient capability to do necessary congestion detection and
   avoidance and therefore cannot prevent congestion collapse.  Host-to-
   host or application-to-application deployment across the Internet
   will require the encapsulation of BFD within a transport that
   provides "TCP-friendly" [<a href="#ref-TFRC" title="&quot;TCP Friendly Rate Control (TFRC): Protocol Specification&quot;">TFRC</a>] behavior.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-3" href="#section-3">3</a>.  Issues</span>

   There are three primary issues in the use of BFD for multihop paths.
   The first is security and spoofing; [<a href="#ref-BFD-1HOP" title="&quot;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for IPv4 and IPv6 (Single Hop)&quot;">BFD-1HOP</a>] describes a
   lightweight method of avoiding spoofing by requiring a Time to Live
   (TTL)/Hop Limit of 255 on both transmit and receive, but this
   obviously does not work across multiple hops.  The utilization of BFD
   authentication addresses this issue.

   The second, more subtle, issue is that of demultiplexing multiple BFD
   sessions between the same pair of systems to the proper BFD session.
   In particular, the first BFD packet received for a session may carry



<span class="grey">Katz &amp; Ward                  Standards Track                    [Page 2]</span></pre>
<hr class='noprint'/><!--NewPage--><pre class='newpage'><span id="page-3" ></span>
<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5883">RFC 5883</a>                 BFD for Multihop Paths                June 2010</span>


   a Your Discriminator value of zero, resulting in ambiguity as to
   which session the packet should be associated.  Once the
   discriminator values have been exchanged, all further packets are
   demultiplexed to the proper BFD session solely by the contents of the
   Your Discriminator field.

   [<a id="ref-BFD-1HOP">BFD-1HOP</a>] addresses this by requiring that multiple sessions
   traverse independent physical or logical links -- the first packet is
   demultiplexed based on the link over which it was received.  In the
   more general case, this scheme cannot work, as two paths over which
   BFD is running may overlap to an arbitrary degree (including the
   first and/or last hop).

   Finally, the Echo function MUST NOT be used over multiple hops.
   Intermediate hops would route the packets back to the sender, and
   connectivity through the entire path would not be possible to verify.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-4" href="#section-4">4</a>.  Demultiplexing Packets</span>

   There are a number of possibilities for addressing the demultiplexing
   issue that may be used, depending on the application.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.1" href="#section-4.1">4.1</a>.  Totally Arbitrary Paths</span>

   It may be desired to use BFD for liveness detection over paths for
   which no part of the route is known (or if known, may not be stable).
   A straightforward approach to this problem is to limit BFD deployment
   to a single session between a source/destination address pair.
   Multiple sessions between the same pair of systems must have at least
   one endpoint address distinct from one another.

   In this scenario, the initial packet is demultiplexed to the
   appropriate BFD session based on the source/destination address pair
   when Your Discriminator is set to zero.

   This approach is appropriate for general connectivity detection
   between systems over routed paths and is also useful for OSPF Virtual
   Links [<a href="#ref-OSPFv2" title="&quot;OSPF Version 2&quot;">OSPFv2</a>] [<a href="#ref-OSPFv3" title="&quot;OSPF for IPv6&quot;">OSPFv3</a>].

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.2" href="#section-4.2">4.2</a>.  Out-of-Band Discriminator Signaling</span>

   Another approach to the demultiplexing problem is to signal the
   discriminator values in each direction through an out-of-band
   mechanism prior to establishing the BFD session.  Once learned, the
   discriminators are sent as usual in the BFD Control packets;  no
   packets with Your Discriminator set to zero are ever sent.  This
   method is used by the BFD MPLS specification [<a href="#ref-BFD-MPLS" title="&quot;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for MPLS Label Switched Paths (LSPs)&quot;">BFD-MPLS</a>].




<span class="grey">Katz &amp; Ward                  Standards Track                    [Page 3]</span></pre>

<span class="grey"><a href="./rfc5883">RFC 5883</a>                 BFD for Multihop Paths                June 2010</span>


   This approach is advantageous because it allows BFD to be directed by
   other system components that have knowledge of the paths in use, and
   from the perspective of BFD implementation it is very simple.

   The disadvantage is that it requires at least some level of BFD-
   specific knowledge in parts of the system outside of BFD.

<span class="h3"><a class="selflink" id="section-4.3" href="#section-4.3">4.3</a>.  Unidirectional Links</span>

   Unidirectional links are classified as multihop paths because the
   return path (which should exist at some level in order to make the
   link useful) may be arbitrary, and the return paths for BFD sessions
   protecting parallel unidirectional links may overlap or even be
   identical.  (If two unidirectional links, one in each direction, are
   to carry a single BFD session, this can be done using the single-hop
   approach.)

   Either of the two methods outlined earlier may be used in the
   unidirectional link case, but a more general solution can be found
   strictly within BFD and without addressing limitations.

   The approach is similar to the one-hop specification, since the
   unidirectional link is a single hop.  Let's define the two systems as
   the Unidirectional Sender and the Unidirectional Receiver.  In this
   approach, the Unidirectional Sender MUST operate in the Active role
   (as defined in the base BFD specification), and the Unidirectional
   Receiver MUST operate in the Passive role.

   In the Passive role, by definition, the Unidirectional Receiver does
   not transmit any BFD Control packets until it learns the
   discriminator value in use by the other system (upon receipt of the
   first BFD Control packet).  The Unidirectional Receiver demultiplexes
   the first packet to the proper BFD session based on the physical or
   logical link over which it was received.  This allows the receiver to
   learn the remote discriminator value, which it then echoes back to
   the sender in its own (arbitrarily routed) BFD Control packet, after
   which time all packets are demultiplexed solely by discriminator.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-5" href="#section-5">5</a>.  Encapsulation</span>

   The encapsulation of BFD Control packets for multihop application in
   IPv4 and IPv6 is identical to that defined in [<a href="#ref-BFD-1HOP" title="&quot;Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) for IPv4 and IPv6 (Single Hop)&quot;">BFD-1HOP</a>], except that
   the UDP destination port MUST have a value of 4784.  This can aid in
   the demultiplexing and internal routing of incoming BFD packets.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-6" href="#section-6">6</a>.  Authentication</span>

   By their nature, multihop paths expose BFD to spoofing.  As the
   number of hops increases, the exposure to attack grows.  As such,
   implementations of BFD SHOULD utilize cryptographic authentication
   over multihop paths to help mitigate denial-of-service attacks.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-7" href="#section-7">7</a>.  IANA Considerations</span>

   Port 4784 has been assigned by IANA for use with BFD Multihop
   Control.

<span class="h2"><a class="selflink" id="section-8" href="#section-8">8</a>.  Security Considerations</span>

   As the number of hops increases, BFD becomes further exposed to
   attack.  The use of strong forms of authentication is strongly
   encouraged.

   No additional security issues are raised in this document beyond
   those that exist in the referenced BFD documents.
